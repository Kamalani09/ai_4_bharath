## 📌 Problem Statement

Managing personal finances is challenging for many individuals due to scattered expense tracking, lack of visibility into spending patterns, and absence of actionable insights. Most people rely on manual methods or multiple apps, which makes it difficult to understand where money is going, identify overspending, and plan budgets effectively.

There is a need for a secure, user-friendly system that helps users track expenses, analyze spending behavior, and receive intelligent recommendations to improve financial decision-making.
